# Project: anyLLM

This project aims to explore the use of a dual-LLM system for text generation and refinement. It is purely a clinet side: HTML/javascript application with calls to LLMs API.

## Ultimate Goal: Dual-LLM System

The core idea is to use two distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) in a pipeline:

1.  **Primary LLM:** A high-quality, powerful model that generates the initial response based on a comprehensive context.
    - **Input:** System prompt, conversation history, and a new user prompt.
    - **Output:** A generated text response.

2.  **Secondary LLM:** A lightweight, faster model that refines the output of the primary LLM.
    - **Input:** Its own system prompt, the original prompt given to the primary LLM, and the response generated by the primary LLM.
    - **Output:** A rewritten version of the response, preserving the original meaning but potentially improving style, conciseness, or other attributes.

## Development Roadmap

To achieve this goal, the project will be developed in stages, starting with a foundational piece of the user interface.

- **Current Step:** [MVP0: Simple JSON File Editor](./MVP0.md)

The first milestone is to build a simple web-based tool for browsing and editing structured text files (JSON). This will serve as a basis for the user-facing part of the application.
