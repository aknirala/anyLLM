# Page Skeleton

This document describes the basic layout of the `anyLLM.html` page.

## Right Pane

The right pane is for the main content. It has two parts:

*   **LLM Selection:** At the top, there is a collapsible section for selecting LLMs and managing API keys. This section should be expanded by default.
*   **Conversation:** The bottom part is for the chat conversation.
